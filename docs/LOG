2019-04-04 (v1.05)
- 'min_depl_lev_local.mo.97' in the sample input file '0p9739.enr'
  has been corrected as:
  min_depl_lev_local.mo.97 = 0.00005
  --> min_depl_lev_local.mo.97 = 0.00010
- The output path can now be specified via the command-line option.

2019/04/03 (v1.04)
- Source code reorganized
- Yield calculation routines removed
- Data reduction format 'gp' --> 'dat'
- Term changed: enrichment ratio --> enrichment level
- The fraction type to refer to the enrichment level can now be selected
  between amount fraction and mass fraction
- Minimum depletion levels (global and local) can be specified
- Depletion order can be specified
- Amount of Mo element in a Mo target has been added to
  the equation calculating the mass fraction of the Mo element
  for clarification.
- DCCs are calculated for all the nuclides involved
  in the Mo target in question
- Product nuclides are associated with the calculated DCCs.
- Output formats can be designated via the command-line option

2018/11/25 (v1.0.3)
- The routines write_to_data_files() and write_to_pwm_data_files()
  can now designate a row-col pair or a cell, at which the panes
  of the output spreadsheet (.xlsx) will be frozen.

2018/11/22 (v1.0.2)
- The verbose option is also applied to the 'convert_fracs' routine.
- Subroutine name modification:
  calc_elem_avg_molar_mass --> calc_elem_wgt_avg_molar_mass
- Terminology modifications according to the IUPAC Gold Book:
  number of moles --> amount of substance
  mole fraction   --> amount fraction
- The author came to know that the equation for the average
  molar mass of a Mo element weighted by "mass" fractions
  was wrong; this equation, which is a weighted arithmetic mean,
  works only for "amount"-fraction weighting.
  For "mass"-fraction weighting, on the other hand,
  the mean should be a weighted harmonic mean.
  Accordingly, the subroutine 'calc_elem_wgt_avg_molar_mass' now uses
  a weighted arithmetic mean for "amount"-fraction weighting, and
  a weighted harmonic mean for "mass"-fraction weighting.
- Amount fractions are now written to datasets in the column
  next to the column of mass fractions.
- The string 'enri' is no longer attached to pwm filenames.

2018/11/02 (v1.0.1)
- Misnomer correction: beam_rad --> beam_fwhm

2018/11/01 (v1.0.0)
- First release
