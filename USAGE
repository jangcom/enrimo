    NAME
        enrimo - Examine the influence of an enriched/depleted Mo isotope

    SYNOPSIS
        perl enrimo.pl [-target=mo_tar ...] [-isotope=mass_num] [-enri=range]
                       [-dcc_init=enri] [-verbose]
                       [-yield_for=file] [-pwm_for=enri ...] [-overwrite]
                       [-nopause]

    DESCRIPTION
        This program generates data files for investigating the influence of
        an enriched or depleted Mo isotope on Mo targets and elemental Mo.
        The following quantities, as functions of the enrichment ratio (i.e.
        the mass fraction) of the Mo isotope of interest, are generated
        for each of the Mo targets designated:
        - Amount fraction of Mo-100
        - Mass fraction of elemental Mo
        - Mass and number densities of the Mo target in question
          and the associated elemental Mo and the Mo isotope of interest
        - Yield and specific yield of the product radionuclide

    OPTIONS
        Value separator: the comma (,)
        -target=mo_tar (default: momet)
            all
                All of the following mo_tar's.
            momet
                Metallic Mo.
            moo2
                Mo(IV) oxide (aka Mo dioxide).
            moo3
                Mo(VI) oxide (aka Mo trioxide).
        -isotope=mass_num (default: 100)
            92
            94
            95
            96
            97
            98  <= Mo-98(n,g)Mo-99
            100 <= Mo-100(g,n)Mo-99, Mo-100(n,2n)Mo-99, Mo-100(p,2n)Tc-99m
        -enri=range (default: 0,0.01,1)
            A range of the enrichment ratios.
            e.g. 0.1,0.5    (beg,end; incre is automatically determined)
            e.g. 0,0.001,1  (beg,incre,end)
            e.g. 0,0.0001,1 (beg,incre,end)
        -dcc_init=enri (default: 0.01)
            The initial mass fraction of the Mo isotope of interest,
            with which density change coefficients (DCCs) will be calculated
            for the enrichment ratios designated.
            The number of decimal places must be the same as -enri=range.
            For example:
            (Valid)   -enri=0,0.0001,1 -dcc_init=0.1015
            (Invalid) -enri=0,0.001,1  -dcc_init=0.1015
        -verbose
            Display the process of isotopic enrichment and
            its effects in real time.
        -yield_for=file
            An input file describing yield calculation conditions.
            Sample files: gn.enr, n2n.enr, p2n.enr
        -pwm_for=enri
            Generate pointwise (or energywise) multiplication reporting files
            for the designated enrichment ratios.
            Ignored if -yield_for= has not been given a filename.
        -overwrite
            Overwrite existing interpolated xs and MC fluence files.
            Ignored if -yield_for= has not been given a filename.
        -nopause
            The shell is not paused at the end of the program.
            You may want to use it for a batch run.
