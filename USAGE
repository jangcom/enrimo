DESCRIPTION
        This program generates datasets for investigating the influence of
        an enriched Mo isotope on its associated Mo material, Mo element,
        and companion isotopes.
        The following quantities, as functions of the enrichment level of
        the Mo isotope to be enriched, are calculated for Mo materials:
        - Amount fractions and and mass fractions of Mo and O isotopes
        - Mass fractions of Mo and O elements
        - Mass and number densities of the Mo material, Mo and O elements,
          and their isotopes
        - Density change coefficients (DCCs) of Mo and O isotopes

        Multiple values are separated by the comma (,).
