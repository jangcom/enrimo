v1.05 (2019/04/04)
  - 'min_depl_lev_local.mo.97' in the sample input file '0p9739.enr'
    has been corrected as:
    min_depl_lev_local.mo.97 = 0.00005
    --> min_depl_lev_local.mo.97 = 0.00010
  - The output path can now be specified via the command-line option.

v1.04 (2019/04/03)
  - Source code reorganized
  - Yield calculation routines removed
  - Data reduction format 'gp' --> 'dat'
  - Term changed: enrichment ratio --> enrichment level
  - The fraction type to refer to the enrichment level can now be selected
    between amount fraction and mass fraction
  - Minimum depletion levels (global and local) can be specified
  - Depletion order can be specified
  - Amount of Mo element in a Mo target has been added to
    the equation calculating the mass fraction of the Mo element
    for clarification.
  - DCCs are calculated for all the nuclides involved
    in the Mo target in question
  - Product nuclides are associated with the calculated DCCs.
  - Output formats can be designated via the command-line option

v1.0.3 (2018/11/25)
  - The routines write_to_data_files() and write_to_pwm_data_files()
    can now designate a row-col pair or a cell, at which the panes
    of the output spreadsheet (.xlsx) will be frozen.

v1.0.2 (2018/11/22)
  - The verbose option is also applied to the 'convert_fracs' routine.
  - Subroutine name modification:
      calc_elem_avg_molar_mass --> calc_elem_wgt_avg_molar_mass
  - Terminology modifications according to the IUPAC Gold Book:
      number of moles --> amount of substance
      mole fraction   --> amount fraction
  - The author came to know that the equation for the average
    molar mass of a Mo element weighted by "mass" fractions
    was wrong; this equation, which is a weighted arithmetic mean,
    works only for "amount"-fraction weighting.
    For "mass"-fraction weighting, on the other hand,
    the mean should be a weighted harmonic mean.
    Accordingly, the subroutine 'calc_elem_wgt_avg_molar_mass' now uses
    a weighted arithmetic mean for "amount"-fraction weighting, and
    a weighted harmonic mean for "mass"-fraction weighting.
  - Amount fractions are now written to datasets in the column
    next to the column of mass fractions.
  - The string 'enri' is no longer attached to pwm filenames.

v1.0.1 (2018/11/02)
  - Misnomer correction: beam_rad --> beam_fwhm

v1.0.0 (2018/11/01)
  - First release
