v1.0.2 (2018/11/22)
  - The verbose option is also applied to the 'convert_fracs' routine.
  - Subroutine name modification:
      calc_elem_avg_molar_mass --> calc_elem_wgt_avg_molar_mass
  - Terminology modifications according to the IUPAC Gold Book:
      number of moles --> amount of substance
      mole fraction   --> amount fraction
  - The author came to know that the equation for the average
    molar mass of a Mo element weighted by "mass" fractions
    was wrong; this equation, which is a weighted arithmetic mean,
    works only for "amount"-fraction weighting.
    For "mass"-fraction weighting, on the other hand,
    the mean should be a weighted harmonic mean.
    Accordingly, the subroutine 'calc_elem_wgt_avg_molar_mass' now uses
    a weighted arithmetic mean for "amount"-fraction weighting, and
    a weighted harmonic mean for "mass"-fraction weighting.
  - Amount fractions are now written to datasets in the column
    next to the column of mass fractions.
  - The string 'enri' is no longer attached to pwm filenames.
